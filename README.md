# Prerequisites
Please refer to "environment.yml" 

# Usage
For our method, please run:
```
python3 ts_underdamp.py
```
For the baseline, please run:
```
python3 ts_overdamp.py
```
Results:

## Further example
To see the results in the appendix, we first used [google-maps-scraper
](https://github.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper) to collect Google Maps reviews from several restaurants.

The data were further processed and saved in the folder "./data/" as txt files.

Then please run:
```
python3 restaurant_plot.py --n_round 200 --batch_size 5 --reward_size 10 --step_size 1e-2
```
